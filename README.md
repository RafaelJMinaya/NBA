# NBA 3-Point Shooting Evolution and Analysis

From the ABA and NBA merger to the new In-Season Tournament, the NBA has been through many different eras, and each came with revolutionary changes to the game. One of the most important eras is today's 3-Point Revolution, whose inception can be traced to the implementation of the radical 3-Point line in 1976.
